# wm

This is an experimental X11-based window manager.
It start as a fork of [tinywm](https://github.com/mackstann/tinywm), but will likely mature to a very restricted subset of features of more major window managers.

It is not really intended to be for public use (though if anyone wishes to use it, it will be freely available).
